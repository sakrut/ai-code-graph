Get method context before editing: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:
1. Run `ai-code-graph context "$ARGUMENTS" --db ./ai-code-graph/graph.db`
2. If the database doesn't exist, inform the user to run `ai-code-graph analyze` first
3. Review the output: complexity, callers, callees, cluster, and duplicates
4. If complexity (CC) is high (>10), warn about the method's complexity before making changes
5. If the method has callers, note that changes may affect those callers
6. If duplicates exist, suggest whether the change should also apply to the duplicate methods
7. Proceed with the user's requested edit, keeping the context in mind
